## World

`cognate_world` defines the environment - `World` - with which the mind interacts.

A world should

  1. Encapsulate the concept of physical space, building up from the atomic fractum.
  2. Provide a system & utilities forone to define an arbitrary space that is consistent with the theory.

For example, TODO

Debate separating this.




handles two core responsibilites
1. defines the rules (specification) of the environment. The `Realizing(World)` holds the environment state.

### Rules

A world is represnted by the set of rules that describes its spacetime.

Critically, rules are mutable. The mind can modify the rules as an action.

Note as always how the rules describing these might be higher-level rules, etc...

The self-referencing of rules embeds the notion of an ordered stack. (TODO generalize stack with self-referencing?)

A design goal is to make the data model for the rules of the game be dynamical
This represents that certain "rules of the game" can change, and in fact might
be the primary parameters of change for an unsupervised learner.
